        <p>Pendulum is an Australian drum and bass band founded in 2002. Pendulum originally formed in the city of Perth, 
            Western Australia, by Rob Swire, Gareth McGrillen and Paul "El Hornet" Harding. The band was later expanded to include 
            members Ben Mount, Peredur ap Gwynedd and KJ Sawka. Members Swire and McGrillen also formed the electro house duo Knife Party. 
            The group is notable for its distinctive sound, mixing electronic music with hard rock and covering a wide range of genres.

            In 2003, Swire, McGrillen and Harding relocated to the United Kingdom. The debut studio album, Hold Your Colour, was released 
            in 2005 to positive critical reception. While Hold Your Colour was mostly of the drum and bass genre, the succeeding albums In 
            Silico and Immersion saw experimentation of other genres such as industrial rock and electronic rock.
            
            In August 2013, Swire announced that a new album may be released in 2014, although Swire and McGrillen later confessed on 
            their Reddit AMA that they had become disillusioned with Pendulum and have no interest at present in producing any new material.
            Despite this, on 20 March 2016, Pendulum reunited to perform at the Ultra Music Festival in Miami, Florida, marking their official 
            return as a live act. Soon after this, Swire, via Twitter, said that he would make a 
            new Pendulum album, and later clarified that a remix album, The Reworks, would come first, followed by new material.</p>
            
            <p>Before Pendulum, Rob Swire and Gareth McGrillen were in multiple rock and metal music bands before Swire influenced McGrillen 
                into producing electronic music on their computers. Harding had been the drummer in a punk band since the mid 1990s. Both their 
                bands had played together at the same shows, but they did not meet until a drum and bass night in 2002. They all had a passion for 
                electronic music and formed Pendulum, incorporating their previous influences of rock and metal music from their previous projects.

                Pendulum began their career in Perth, Western Australia as a trio of DJs. Harding had been active in the Perth drum and bass scene 
                for some time, DJing under the name "El Hornet". Swire and McGrillen had played friends parties, mainly DJing from their computers. 
                Initially Swire and McGrillen wanted to start a record label and release songs on it. One evening they were meant to play a DJ set on 
                The Perth Producers night at The Drumclub, but Swire's hard drive failed. Harding offered to play their music instead which was received well. 
                They sat down with each other and decided to produce music together under the name Pendulum.
                
                The first track the trio produced was 'Vault', which would be released in 2003 on 31 Records to great acclaim within the UK drum and bass 
                scene. At that moment they were residing in Perth, but they felt isolated from the drum and bass community. Once fellow drum and bass 
                artist DJ Fresh offered them free accommodation in his London flat for eight months, they decided to move to England.
                
                The band also recorded and released 'Spiral / Ulterior Motive' the same year, and in 2004 made their first compilation appearance on 
                'Jungle Sound: The Bassline Strikes Back!', with several songs featured and Harding in charge of mixing the album's second disc. The 
                band was offered an album deal by Breakbeat Kaos, Fresh' label, which resulted in their debut album Hold Your Colour in 2005. The album 
                charted in both the United Kingdom and in Australia and was certified as a golden album in Australia.
                
                Following the success of their 2005 debut album, their label Breakbeat Kaos re-issued the compilation under the name Jungle Sound Gold, the 
                
            front now saying "mixed by Pendulum". The band disapproved of this as they had neither given permission nor been informed about the release,
             and Pendulum later ended up leaving the label.
                
                In 2006, the trio became a sextet after introducing Ben Mount as their MC, Peredur ap Gwynedd as their Guitarist and Paul Kodish as their drummer. 
                At this time McGrillen began playing bass guitar at live shows and on some studio recordings.</p>
